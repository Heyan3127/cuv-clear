# cuv-clear
CUV clear means the Chinese Union Version Bible without chapter and verse numbers.

This CUV bible clear version (without chapter and verse numbers) has been coded and processed by zoom.quiet who is a friend of wangpei, a Chinese Christian. This project is inspired by @Heyan3127. 

Many thanks to zoom.quiet.

God bless him and all he loves forever and ever.

Amen.
